# About

Project based on The Cherno's Ray Tracing tutorial: https://youtu.be/gfW1Fhd9u9Q?si=rz2dujbVs99lQBup

3D model handling based on: https://github.com/NickPhilomath/RayTracing

App template: https://github.com/StudioCherno/WalnutAppTemplate

3D models loading note:
- Models must be triangulated (polygons must be triangles, otherwise objects are going to appear glitched)
- Model's file must be in .obj format
- WalnutApp.cpp contains an example how to add a cube.obj object to the scene (path may be absolute)

Sample scene render:
